SMTPFilter Log Analyzer

This script analyzes SMTPFilter logs. SMTPFilter uses SPAMASSASSIN as the SPAM
filter underlying software.

The main intention is to calculate total processed emails, spam emails, ham emails 
and email errors that might be important. 

Analysing logs:

1.Search for the keyword smtpfilter on each line in the file "maillog" under the /var/log
directory. These are the essential entries to know what smtpfilter is doing.

How do we identify a particular email processed by SMTPFilter?

The ideal would be for each process to be unique. This uniqueness is based on machine
name and process id within that machine. For example, the following gives the process id
on the logs: smtpfilter[13035]. The problems with that is there might be more than one
process with the id "13035", remember that we have more than one machine that can create 
the same process. In order to solve this we have to add the machine name to the process id
created for that specific process. The result would be the following: cerebro-spam smtpfilter[13035].
This will give a unique identity to each email process by smptfilter.

2.There is an id for each smtpfilter entry.
