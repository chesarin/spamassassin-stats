This script will analyze the logs from spamassasin in order
to calculate basic stats such as: spam emails, non-spam, errors.

Analysing logs:

1.Search for smtpfilter entries on the logs. These are the entries that are essential
to know what is smtpfilter doing.

How do we identify a particular process?
Well, the ideal would be for each process to be unique. This
uniqueness is based on machine name and process id within that machine.
For example the following gives the process id on logs:
smtpfilter[13035]
The problems with that is that there might be more than one 13035 since
we have more than one machine that can create the same process.
The other way to solve this is by adding the machine name to it.

cerebro-spam smtpfilter[13035]

This will give a unique identity to each email process by smptfilter.

2.There is an id for each smtpfilter entry.
